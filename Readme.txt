# Acmegrade project

Project: Build an E-commerce website where vendors will provide their own products onto the website for advertise them and then the customers can buy products from there.

Aim: Create not a full fledged website, however create a MVP for a startup.

An MVP is a minimum Viable Product **a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle**.
